##  Setup Instructions (Step by Step)

### Step 1 — Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 — Copy the Dataset
Copy `fashion.csv` from your Kaggle dataset into this folder:
```
c:\Users\Mohit Sharma\Desktop\fashion\fashion.csv
```
*(Your notebook used it from: `/root/.cache/kagglehub/datasets/vikashrajluhaniwal/fashion-images/versions/1/data/fashion.csv`)*

### Step 3 — Get a Gemini API Key
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Create a free API key

### Step 4 — Set the API Key
```bash
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 5 — Run Database Setup (ONE TIME ONLY)
```bash
python setup_database.py
```
This will:
- Create `fashion.db` with all 2906 products + simulated prices
- Generate vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers
- Store vectors in ChromaDB

⏱️ Takes about 2-5 minutes on first run.

### Step 6 — Start the Web Server
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 7 — Open in Browser
```
http://localhost:5000
```
